# SolarX - Dynamics 365 CRM Integration Project

The project includes CRM customizations, C# plugins, custom workflows, web resources, custom actions, and integration with a standalone ASP.NET Core Web API and SendGrid.

Although it's a compact demo, it represents a solid foundation that can be scaled into a full CRM solution. It demonstrates hands-on experience with Dynamics 365 custom development, .NET API integration, server-side logic, UI automation, and external service integration.

## üí° Features Implemented

### üî∑ CRM Customizations
- Custom tables/entities related to the SolarX business (e.g., Lead, Opportunity, Task).
- Business Process Flow between custom entities (e.g., Lead ‚ûù Opportunity).
- Custom buttons on forms using JavaScript Web Resources.
- Clean UI structured under a dedicated custom app/area.

### üî∑ Plugins (C#)
- **Prevent duplicate emails**: Plugin runs on create to stop duplicate records based on email.

### üî∑ Custom Workflows (C#)
- **Auto-create Task**: When a new opportunity is created, a follow-up task is automatically generated.

### üî∑ Custom Action + SendGrid Email Integration
- Created a **Custom Action** that accepts an email address and sends an email using SendGrid.
- Built a **JavaScript Web Resource** that calls the custom action.
- Added a **button to the form** that triggers the JS function, invoking the action dynamically.
- Configured **Email Server Profile** and **Mailbox** to use SendGrid SMTP (`smtp.sendgrid.net`) for outgoing email.

### üî∑ ASP.NET Core Web API
- Integrated with CRM using OAuth2 + Azure AD App Registration.
- Example endpoint: Create Opportunity from external systems.
- Built with Clean Architecture, DI, DTOs, and follows .NET best practices.
