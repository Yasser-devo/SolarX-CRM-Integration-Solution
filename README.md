# SolarX - Dynamics 365 CRM Integration Project

This is a small-scale but expandable Dynamics 365 CRM solution designed to simulate a real-world business scenario. The project includes customizations, plugins, custom workflows, and integration with a standalone ASP.NET Core Web API.

Although it's a compact demo, it represents a solid foundation that can be scaled into a full CRM solution. It demonstrates hands-on experience with both Dynamics 365 custom development and .NET API integration, showcasing the ability to design, implement, and integrate CRM features from scratch.
